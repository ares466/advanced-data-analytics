## Careers in Data Science

A *data professional* is a term used to describe any individual who works with data and/or has data skills.

To gain insights, businesses rely on data professionals to acquire, organize, and interpret data, which helps inform internal projects and processes. Businesses seek those who can access data and understand its metrics--the methods and criteria that data professionals use to evaluate data.

*Machine learning* is an alternative approach to automation expressing the way you want a task to be done by using data instead of explicit instructions. Machine learning techniques can be used for data analytics and exploration.

**DATA SCIENCE vs DATA ANALYTICS**  

Data science and data analytics are distinct but related disciplines. Organizations often use these terms interchangeably.

| Discipline | Description | Outcomes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data Science | Discipline of making data more useful. A data scientist is a professional that uses raw data to develop new ways to model data and understand the unknown. | Produces broad insights that concentrate on which questions should be asked about data <br> Confronts what is unknown by using advanced techniques to make predictions about the future |
| Data Analysis | Data analytics is a field of study that falls under the larger discipline of data science. The aim of data analytics is to create methods to capture, process, and organize data to uncover actionable insights for current problems. | Emphasizes discovering answers to questions being asked  <br> Determines actionable insights that can be applied immediately based on existing queries |

The *data analytics toolbox* includes:
- Programming languages like Python and R
- Jupyter and R notebooks
- Visualization tools like Tableau
- Storytelling
